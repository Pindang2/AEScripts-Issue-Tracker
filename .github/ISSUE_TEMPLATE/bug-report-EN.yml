      Please write the title at the top. Briefly describe the issue, such as [BUG] Script UI is not displaying.
      ```
      Unfortunately, I do not currently have an Apple Mac product, so it is difficult to fix bugs that
      occur in the Mac OS environment. If I acquire a Mac, I will try to fix bugs that occur exclusively in Mac OS.
      I apologize for the inconvenience!
